# TAU: Moodle Login Skipper
Life is too short to enter your ID every time.


# How to use:
1. Download the whole repository as a package (Code > Download ZIP)
2. Change the file "settings.js" to hold your username, password and ID
3. Go to chrome's extensions page: [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions/) at chrome://extensions/
4. Enable developer mode
5. Click on "Load unpacked" and point it at the downloaded folder

Now you should be able to visit the moodle login page, and a single click on the extension icon will log you in :)
